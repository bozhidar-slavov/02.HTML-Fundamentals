### Problem 1. Refactoring
*	Refactor (edit) the [homework-refactoring.html](https://github.com/bozhidar-slavov/02.HTML-Fundamentals/blob/master/images/04.Semantic-HTML/homework-refactoring.html) web page and make it HTML semantic.

### Problem 2. Student System
*	Create a web page using semantic HTML by the design.
*	Use some kind of approach to support old (non-HTML5-compatible) Web browsers like IE8.
